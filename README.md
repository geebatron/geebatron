My main focus at the moment is on full stack web development. ~~I work every day on my understanding of GraphQL and Prisma to build apps that make use of relational databases.~~ My foundation of programming was laid building in Python, and extending from that I build in JavaScript. I strive to create **functional and intuitive apps** with *understandable and maintainable code*.
